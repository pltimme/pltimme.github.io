<p>When I stumbled across a career in product management and it was like carrots and hummus: the world is incomplete without. I love learning about problems and how the combination of processes and technology can turn vexatious problems into delightful experiences. I appreciate great design, am fascinated by data insights, and my favorite type of news is business.  In a nutshell, I am a product nerd. When I am not reading Product Hunt, I am a traveler, a gourmand, and an emotional supporter to my wife when she watches her “reality” TV.</p>
